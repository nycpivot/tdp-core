This is an app generated by the Tanzu Portal Builder.

## Building the portal with buildpack

To build a Docker image containing the app, you can run the following command:

```shell
image_tag=portal:1.0.0 yarn buildpack
```

Set the tag of the Docker image in the `image_tag` environment variable.

The [app-config.pack.yaml](./app-config.pack.yaml) file is a configuration file that aligns the frontend port with the one defined in [app-config.yaml](./app-config.yaml).

The [Procfile](./Procfile) file contains the command that is used to run the app in the Docker container.

To run a container from the created image, use the following command:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 7007:7007 portal:1.0.0
```

You can use the --env options from docker to pass environment variables.
