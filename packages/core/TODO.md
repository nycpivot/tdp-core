# TPB Core library

Core interfaces used for TPB plugins. This should be published to an
easily accessible npm registry.

## TODO

This creates a dependency on the backend package for react. We should
double check if we really want this behavior or if we wanna split this
library into 2 (frontend and backend).

TODO: ESBACK-337 - Remove this package once the plugins have been migrated to use @tpb/core-frontend or @tpb/core-backend.
