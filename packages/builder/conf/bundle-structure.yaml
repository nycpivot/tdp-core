# This file configures the output structure of the portal.
#
# There are three kinds of nodes:
#
# - folder node that only have the name and files properties, name representing the name the folder will have
# - template node that configures files that will be generated with handlebars.
#   The name is the name of the file that will be generated and the template property is the path to the handlebar template.
# - copy node that configures files that must be copied from some location to some output location.
#   The name is the name of the file (or folder) that will be generated and copy is the path to the file (or folder)
#   that must be copied from.
#
# Note that the paths for template & copy properties are relative to the root of this package.
